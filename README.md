# OpenGL Series

This repo represents my OpenGL learning series.

I will try to push codes incrementally.

It contains my learning sources as well.

Codes are divided to episodes. There is a branch for each episode for tracking:

1. index-buffer-example

2. gl-error-handling

3. uniform

4. vertex-arrays

5. abstracting-classes

6. buffer-layout-abstraction

7. shader-abstraction

8. basic-renderer

9. textures

10. blending

11. math-intro

12. projection-matrix

13. model-view-projection

14. imgui

15. render-multiple-object

16. creating-tests
